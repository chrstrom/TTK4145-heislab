Config
================

The purpose of this package is to collect global constants in once place.
Parameter names are self-explanatory, so I'm not going to reapeat shit here :) just
read config.go

Might be cheese to implement this as a .go file instead of yaml, json, xml etc etc, 
but it works, so we left it at that B)
